        This Dummy code is having the Functionalities of
                                                - Bluetooth device connectivity via phone Settings
                                                - CheckSums

                     -   Bluetooth device connectivity via phone Settings : is to connect to BLE devices
                                                                going into the phone settings.
                                                                But now we are able to connect to
                                                                BLE devices from app itself
                                                                [In app BLE  device connectivity]


                     - CheckSums : CheckSums is to identify the corrupted data.
                                   where firstly the peppl device sends 512 bytes of data simultaneously
                                   then we recieve the
                                   512 bytes of audio data and we will
                                   stream the audio data,before we stream we will compare data send by
                                   pebbl device and the data we recive whether they are correct or not.
                                   if the data is correct we'll stream otherwise we'll again send it
                                   back to pepple device to send the correct data again.


                                   But we are not using this because Later we came to Know that the Streaming in TCP server has
                                   the in-built feature of checksums.
