       Initially we are using Bluetooth BLE for smart configuration and WebSockets for Streaming.


                                         main.dart
                                            |
                                            |
                                            |
            BluetoothBLE();  -->  To scan BLE devices and connecting to that specific Device
                                            |
                                            |
                                            |
            BLEConnection();  -->  we'll Scan available wifi devices and connecting the pebbl device to specific
                                   wifi network by sending wifi name,password and IP Address[for websocket connection]
                                   to pebbl device.
                                   - we can also apply filters and volume adjustments.

                                            |
                                            |
            WebSocketStreamSave();  -->   Here we can Start Streaming and also we able to save the
                                          Streaming audio as a file and play from the app itself from List.
                                          - we can also apply filters and volume adjustments.
                                          - dart files
                                                - Wav_Header();
                                                - File_Entity_List(); are used Here.
