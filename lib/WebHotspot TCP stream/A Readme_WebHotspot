    In this we are Streaming the audio using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) IP,
    where the pebbl device will creates Hotspot and the mobile device will connect
    to that wifi.where the pebbl device will get a IP address by sending that IP
    address to the mobile device we can Stream the audio with in the web.

    * But we are not using this method because :
                        The Streaming is having the more Delay.
                        And we are also unable to save the audio file.
